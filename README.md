# LinkedList
Simple linked list implementation for a data structures refresher

This program utilizes the following methods: insertFirst(), deleteFirst(), displayList(), and insertLast().

There is a node class which contains the data and "next" pointer values that corresponds to each node.
  It also contains a displayNode() method to display the contents of the node.
  
A linked list is created in the main method, where each method is called/tested.
